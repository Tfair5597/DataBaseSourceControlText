/* there's an issue with github in which working in a team can be a problem if multiple people work on the same "branch"
branches are variations of the program i think? by separating a repo into multiple branches we can have each team member
work on one part of a project, push the changes independently and eventually merge everything back into to the master
branch.
we can also designate, or ask for certain features, bugs, or components of a program via issues on github.
we can label these issues, assign them to team members or ask for help on it. this is great especially if the project
is open source. team members can comment on issues as well.
